# Roadtrip

![roadtrip map](/output/roadtrip.png?raw=true)

This repository contains the R code I used to map my roadtrip across the
United States.

## Summary

The R code converts a JSON Google location history file taken from
Google Takeout to an R dataframe. It then uses the ggplot2 package to
draw the route and a dot and label for each of the points of interest.
